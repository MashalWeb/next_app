To create a Pie Chart using ApexCharts in Next.js, you'll need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install ApexCharts and React-ApexCharts

First, you need to install ApexCharts and its React wrapper `react-apexcharts`.

```bash
npm install apexcharts react-apexcharts
```

### Step 2: Create a Pie Chart Component

Create a new component for your Pie Chart. For example, create a file `PieChart.js` inside your `components` directory:

```javascript
// components/PieChart.js

import React from "react";
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";
const ReactApexChart = dynamic(() => import("react-apexcharts"), {
   ssr: false,
});

const PieChart = ({ data }) => {
   const chartOptions = {
      labels: data.map((item) => item.label),
      options: {
         chart: {
            type: "pie",
         },
         responsive: [
            {
               breakpoint: 480,
               options: {
                  chart: {
                     width: 200,
                  },
                  legend: {
                     position: "bottom",
                  },
               },
            },
         ],
      },
      series: data.map((item) => item.value),
   };

   return (
      <div>
         <ReactApexChart
            options={chartOptions.options}
            series={chartOptions.series}
            type="pie"
            height={350}
         />
      </div>
   );
};

export default PieChart;
```

### Step 3: Use the Pie Chart Component

Now, you can use the `PieChart` component in your Next.js pages or components. For example, in a page component (`pages/index.js`):

```javascript
// pages/index.js

import React from "react";
import PieChart from "../components/PieChart";

const chartData = [
   { label: "Category A", value: 30 },
   { label: "Category B", value: 40 },
   { label: "Category C", value: 20 },
   { label: "Category D", value: 10 },
];

const HomePage = () => {
   return (
      <div>
         <h1>Pie Chart Example</h1>
         <PieChart data={chartData} />
      </div>
   );
};

export default HomePage;
```

### Step 4: Customize the Chart

You can further customize the chart by adjusting the `chartOptions` object inside `PieChart.js`. ApexCharts provides extensive configuration options for colors, labels, legends, tooltips, and more. Refer to the [ApexCharts documentation](https://apexcharts.com/docs/react-charts/) for detailed configuration options.

### Step 5: Styling (Optional)

You can add CSS styles either inline or by importing CSS files in your Next.js application to customize the appearance of the chart and its surrounding elements.

### Step 6: Testing

Run your Next.js application to see the Pie Chart in action:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Additional Notes

-  Ensure that your data (`chartData` in this example) is correctly formatted according to the ApexCharts requirements.
-  Handle responsiveness and other UI considerations based on your project requirements.

By following these steps, you should be able to create and integrate a Pie Chart using ApexCharts into your Next.js application effectively. Adjust as per your specific data and styling requirements.
